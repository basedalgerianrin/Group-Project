    <h1 style="text-align:center">History</h1>
        <p> 
        During the year 2006, the world's first gaming chair was first produced. 
        In the United states of Michigan, a small company stepped up and went on to create racecar chairs.
        The company had lots of chairs but no-one to sell them to only because the car industry was decimated during the time of 9/11 terrorist attacks happened.
        DXRacer (The racing seat company) had been the foundation and it focused on the growing popularity of video games.
        Since Esports had been creeping up in popularity. So that meant ordinary chairs were not great for long periods of sitting.
        DXRacer had introduced the world's first gaming chair in 2006.
        Thus came the era of racing-style gaming chairs.
        The design was heavily used as a template for future projects as other companies would make the concept a common product.
        The neutral posture technique was transferred into an ergonomic office chair twenty-one years later. 
        Early Esports players required the same ergonomic support as office workers, but no formality.
        The world's first racing-style gaming chair was produced.
